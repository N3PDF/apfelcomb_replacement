**pineko** converts

- interpolation grids for theory predictions (*grids* for short) in the form of
  |pineappl| grids, together with
- |EKO| generated by |eko|

into fast-kernel (**FK**) tables. The collection of all FK tables constitute the
theory predictions for a PDF fit and therefore is often simply called *theory*.

*pineko* is:

* open-source - allowing a community effort for writing a new generation of tools for PDF fits

* written in Python - opting for a popular, high-level language to facilitate other authors to participate in the project

* part of the N3PDF software compendium for HEP theory: |eko|, |banana|, |pineappl| and |yadism|

`pineko` replaces `APFELcomb <https://github.com/NNPDF/apfelcomb/>`_ , which was
used up to NNPDF4.0.

|MHOU| from scale variations
****************************
The variation of the **renormalization** and **factorization** scales is one of the most used method to estimate |MHOU| in |QCD|. 

This is due to the semplicity of both their calculation and their implementation, the former given by the fact that the scale dependence
of the strong coupling :math:`\alpha_{s}` and of |PDF| is universal and the latter given by the easiness in calculating the correlations.

However, the scale variations approach also has well known drawbacks:

* there is no unique principle to determine the specific range of the scale variation
* it cannot deal with new singularities or color structrures appearing at higher orders.
